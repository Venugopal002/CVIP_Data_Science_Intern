Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
Objective
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the terrorism dataset to extract meaningful insights and patterns. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, understand attack characteristics, and potentially reveal factors that contribute to terrorist activities.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is related to terrorism incidents. It includes information about the location, time, and characteristics of various terrorist attacks.

Usage
Data Exploration: Use Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore the dataset.
Analysis: Utilize data visualization and statistical methods to identify patterns.
Insights: Extract meaningful insights from the analysis.
Breast Cancer Prediction
Objective
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of relevant features. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning techniques, we aim to develop a reliable tool for assisting medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

Dataset
The breast cancer dataset used for this project includes features related to tumor characteristics and labels indicating benign or malignant status.
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Convert and clean the dataset, handle missing values, and scale features.
Model Development: Implement a machine learning model using TensorFlow and Keras.
Training and Evaluation: Train the model, evaluate its performance, and fine-tune as necessary.
Interactive Prediction: Implement a system for making predictions based on user input.
